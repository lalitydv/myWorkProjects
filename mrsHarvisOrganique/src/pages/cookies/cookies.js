              <p>
                Personal Data we hold about you may be transferred to other
                countries outside your residential country for any of the
                purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You understand and
                accept that these countries may have differing (and potentially
                less stringent) laws relating to the degree of confidentiality
                afforded to the information it holds and that such information
                can become subject to the laws and disclosure requirements of
                such countries, including disclosure to governmental bodies,
                regulatory agencies and private persons, as a result of
                applicable governmental or regulatory inquiry, court order or
                other similar process. In addition, a number of countries have
                agreements with other countries providing for exchange of
                information for law enforcement, tax and other purposes. If we
                transfer your Personal Data to third parties for purposes stated
                in this Privacy Policy, we will use best endeavors to put in
                place appropriate controls and safeguards to ensure that your
                Personal Data is kept accurate, adequately protected, and
                processed only for specified and reasonable purposes in a manner
                that is fair, transparent and has a lawful basis, and is stored
                for no longer than is absolutely necessary.
