              <p>
                We'd love to tell you a little about us. We are a Daughter
                Mother Venture and our brand name is derived by combining name
                initials of both of us - HARSHITA (HAR) and Vinita (VI), which
                sums up as Mrs. HARVI's. Initially, we started making these
                products for our personal use only. And to our surprise, these
                products actually worked wonder for us. And this led us to share
                these 100% authentic & organic products which are handmade by us
                at home. Our product range is wide and offers solutions for
                everyone without compromising on the quality, purity and cost
                efficiency. The organic products at Mrs. Harviâ€™s Organique are
                partly made with love, some new age Ayurveda infusions, and
                loads of home remedies Nani Dadi.
