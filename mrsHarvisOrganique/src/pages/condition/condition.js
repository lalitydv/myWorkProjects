                If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or
                unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not
                limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations
                set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision
                will be deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable
                provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
                provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue
                to be in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms
                of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and HARVI’S
                with respect to the Site/services and it supersedes all prior or
                contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                electronic, oral or written. HARVI’S's failure to act with
                respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to
                act with respect to the breach or subsequent and similar
                breaches.

              <p>
                You acknowledge and hereby agree to these Terms and Conditions
                and that it constitute the complete and exclusive agreement
                between us concerning your use of the Site, and supersede and
                govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.
                We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change/ alter/
                modify these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the
                changes on the Site. Any changes are effective immediately upon
                posting to the Site. Your continued use of the Site thereafter
                constitutes your agreement to all such changed Terms and
                Conditions. We may, with or without prior notice, terminate any
                of the rights granted by these Terms and Conditions. You shall
                comply immediately with any termination or other notice,
                including, as applicable, by ceasing all use of the Site.
                Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be
                construed as creating any agency, partnership, affiliation,
                joint venture or other form of joint enterprise between us. Our
                failure to require your performance of any provision hereof
                shall not affect our full right to require such performance at
                any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any
                provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the
                provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms
                and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any
                applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or
                court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not
                render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a
                whole but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified, to the
                extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully
                reflect the original intent of the parties as reflected in the
                original provision. The headings in the Terms and Conditions are
